- no => functions
- no class syntax

o3DS:
- no localStorage (use document.cookie)
- no WebSocket
- XHR .response does not exist (use responseText)
- no trailing commas in function calls, literals, etc.
- no function.bind
- no element.dataset
- xhr timeout is always 20 seconds, and no .ontimeout event
- no CORS (?)
- no [expr]: key syntax in object literals
- no requestAnimationFrame
- no .remove
- passing non-string to console.log throws error? (maybe)
- new Date(string) and Date.parse(string) don't seem to work?
- no element.classList
- no http DELETE

- no box-sizing: border-box
- no flex (?)
- @media queries don't take viewport into account (3ds screen is reported at 960px lol)
- no :checked?

fix needed:
- editor preview broken?
